**Want to start your Open-Source Contribution journey?**

There are 2 types of approaches:

**Approach 1:**
```
       1)    Learn a tech  properly. Example: Web dev, react js, ML ,AI etc

       2) Go to GitHub and search with this key word . Example : If you have learned react 
            js , then search react js and choose a project to work .Try to go to that project 
            and see if you can contribute in any file

       3)  If you have ideas and codes you want to add to that project, just edit it and then 
             create a pull request . 

        And that’s how you start your contribution journey and then try to apply in various 
        programs . Yes, as you have contributed previously, you have high chances that 
      various programs will check your GitHub profile and select you
 ```


**Approach 2:**
```
        1)    Have a basic knowledge on a topic . Example : Web dev, react js, ML ,AI etc
        2)    Then apply in various programs or projects from GitHub and then contribute 
               and learn what you need to know. It’s called “Learn on the Go”
        Again, you are good to go for awesome programs like Gsoc , GitHub externship 
         program or Fossasia 
```
